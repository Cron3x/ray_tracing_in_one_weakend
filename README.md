# I learn how to Implement a raytracer
---

This is a project to learn how to develop a raytracer, I try to implement the raytracer from the link below in rust and not C++ as in the Tutorial.
So far everything workes...

I only upload the changes to Github so I can develop on diverent devices without the hussle of privat repos
